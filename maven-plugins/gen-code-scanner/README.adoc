Compile time classpath scanner for Java.

== Description

This tool was created to address a problem experienced when developing Microservice applications under Spring.

=== The Problem

In a Microservice, the time the application takes to start is paramount. But further because a Microservice
is starting in a cluster with other already running services, it must be a good *neighbour*. It cannot start and
suddenly consume all of the CPU on the server it is running on, starving the other services of resources.

As such, Microservices must be started with a resource limtation on their CPU to prevent this from happening, but you
don't want this to be too high otherwise your scheduler will under-utilize a server and you come back to the problem
of starving neighbours of resources.

Resource limits, especially in schedulers like Kubernetes act as horizontal scaling indicators as well. So you need
to ensure you set your resource requirements so that the scheduler will trigger a scale out if a CPU ratio is hit
for a specific period of time.

For this reason, it is extremely important that your Microservice starts as quickly as possible with as little CPU as
possible. Microservices need to be as _deliberate_ as possible in their use of resources, and typical development models
that hand you an "easy to use framework" generally make you less deliberate.

We try and give our Microservices a limit of 400-500 millicores of CPU. A service should be able to start in less
than 30 seconds with this limitation as long as it isn't trying to do database migrations or similar sorts of things.

=== Being _Deliberate_

Our Spring applications, like most Spring applications used classpath scanning. Every single time a full classpath
scan has to happen, tens of thousands of classes have to be evaluated to see if they meet a specific criteria. This
often happens multiple times as Spring has encouraged developers over time to simplify their wiring this way.

This ends up using considerable CPU resources at _runtime_, for a process that could just as easily be done at
*compile* time. And that is what this Maven plugin attempts to address, allowing you to use a flexible classpath scanner
that works at compile time.

=== How it works

The gencode scanner scans _source code_ - not compiled classes (at the moment). It will scan through packages
 you tell it to scan through, matching criteria you tell it to match, and then puts discovered items into "groups".
 Once it has finished, it hands the "groups" to templates you have defined - so you can do what you want with them.

It does this because it allows each module (usually a Maven project) to provide generated classes
 that contain the configuration necessary to use them.

Consider the following:

 - a library of Spring components, generating an interface or class that you could then use to tell Spring
how to wire up the project - as if you did it by hand.
 - a JAX-RS API containing a bunch of interfaces that you could automatically generate the client proxies for
 - scan for all web resources (e.g. servlets and filters) and register them with the servlet container instead of
   having the container have to scan for them

Lets take a look from the sample app. Given the simplicity of the sample apps, it would probably not be worth
using the plugin to automatically generate the configuration, but it is used for illustrative purposes in those
applications.

There are two sections here, `packages` and `templates`. There is a third, called `scans` but it is not detailed here
(yet) as it is essentially a break-out of the `packages` section. During development `scans` collapsed into `packages`
for most use cases.

==== packages

This section allows you to specify a path to scan, in essentially the format:

package[-modifiers]=group[,group...]:[sub-package[,sub-package...]][/[@Annotations,...]

modifiers:
- r : do not recurse, when `-r` is seen, it means don't recurse into any further levels.

If you had a code base who's primary base package was (say) `cd.connect.samples.slackapp`
and you wished to grab all of the classes in the sub packages `dao`, `security` and `rest`
and put them in the `spring` _group_, but no other sub-packages, you could do this:

----
<package>cd.connect.samples.slackapp=spring: dao, security, rest</package>
----

_groups_ are instances of the java `Set` class, so they won't duplicate. If you then wanted
to ensure all of your @Singleton annotated classes were picked up as well, you could add

----
<package>cd.connect.samples.slackapp=spring: dao, security, rest</package>
<package>cd.connect.samples.slackapp=spring/@Singleton</package>
----

if you know that all Jersey classes are also Spring classes, and they are in the rest package,
you could do this:

----
<package>cd.connect.samples.slackapp.rest=spring, rest</package>
----

Later we will add the ability to add custom hand-off classes so you can have the scanner
pass each class off to your processor, along with configuration that is relevant and
have it store meta-data that will be available in your templates.

==== templates

The templates section just allows you to indicate which _groups_ you then want to hand off
to a Mustache template. A _group_ consists of two fields:

- types : the original Set
- sortedTypes : the above sorted by name

A type (is a shim over the top of the javaparser api's ReferenceTypeDeclaration which
has a considerable amount of information). It also has an array of annotations, each of
which contain a name/value pair of the fields of the annotation (if any).

The group will turn up using its name unless you override it. Overriding it allows you to
use the same template many times in your project for different groups.

Taking the above example

----
<template>
  <name>slackapp-config</name>
  <template>/generator/common-spring.mustache</template>
  <joinGroup>spring, servlet</joinGroup>
  <className>cd.connect.samples.slackapp.SlackAppGenConfig</className>
</template>
----

This will create a template that is:

- name: called slackapp-config (the name is only used for error reporting
and can be left out).
- template: It specifies the template to use - this will be checked for on the classpath
first, then it checks src/main/resources for that offset, and then src/test/resources
- joinGroup: these are the groups that should be made available to the template, and are in the form
`group[=name][,group[=name]...]`. So you could use `spring=components, servlet=web` above and
instead of them turning up as variables called `spring` and `servlet`, they would turn up
as `components` and `web`. This allows you to gather several groups of items that need to be
generated in the same way, but require different actual groups. The jersey templates are often
this way where you have different apis on different mount points, but you use one template.
- className: the class you want generated into target/generate-sources from your template.

An example template looks like this:

[source: mustache]
----
package {{packageName}};

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;
{{#spring}}
  // plain resources
  {{#sortedTypes}}
import {{packageName}}.{{name}};
  {{/sortedTypes}}
{{/spring}}

@Configuration
@Import({ {{#spring}}{{#sortedTypes}}{{name}}.class{{^-last}}, {{/-last}}{{/sortedTypes}}{{/spring}} })
public class {{simpleName}} {
}
----

This is a simple template that only manages Spring wiring, but if your app does a bunch of other things,
it is worthwhile creating more useful templates and sharing them. Ours for example will register Spring
objects, wire up servlets from their declared structures and others that generate Jersey servlet modules
and register apis and implementations.

Another example:

----
package {{packageName}};

import java.util.stream.Stream;
import cd.connect.spring.servlet.ServletModule;
{{#spring}}
  // plain resources
  {{#sortedTypes}}
import {{packageName}}.{{name}};
  {{/sortedTypes}}
{{/spring}}
{{#servlet}}
  // servlets that have WebServlet annotations
  {{#sortedTypes}}
import {{packageName}}.{{name}};
  {{/sortedTypes}}
{{/servlet}}
{{#filter}}
  // filters that have WebFilter annotations
  {{#sortedTypes}}
import {{packageName}}.{{name}};
  {{/sortedTypes}}
{{/filter}}

public class {{simpleName}} extends ServletModule {
  public void register() {
  {{#spring}}
    register(Stream.of(
    {{#sortedTypes}}
      {{name}}.class{{^-last}}, {{/-last}}
    {{/sortedTypes}}
    ));
  {{/spring}}
{{#servlet}}
  // servlets that have WebServlet annotations
  {{#sortedTypes}}
    servlet({{name}}.class);
  {{/sortedTypes}}
{{/servlet}}
{{#filter}}
  // filters that have WebFilter annotations
  {{#sortedTypes}}
    filter({{name}}.class);
  {{/sortedTypes}}
{{/filter}}

  }
}

=== Closing notes

We have found deliberate wiring in our Spring apps considerably decreases the startup time for those
applications - 80 seconds down to 30. There are other techniques that can make your applications start
faster as well.

=== Limitations

- This only works for Java source code. Other JVM languages will have to manually create their
configuration until we extend this.
- It is source code only because in most cases, you want to use the configuration discovered in the same package
you discover it in. This means it needs to happen at the generate-sources phase.

=== Future enhancements

- Expand into compiled classes
- Allowing you to specify interfaces vs classes for an individual package scan
- Add support for a service loader to discover extensions so we can hand off and maintain extra meta-data.
